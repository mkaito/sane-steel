# Sane Steel

It has always bothered me that steel smelting doesn't scale in powers of two.

With this mod, it does.

## Effects

Steel now takes 4 iron plates instead of 5. 8 instead of 10 in Expensive mode.

Energy costs have been adjusted so that 1 iron furnace can feed 1 steel
furnace, so all your (non-module) blueprints should continue working, but
produce an extra 20% steel in the same amount of time.

## Balance

You might argue that this makes the game easier. Twice as much in Expensive
mode. And technically, you would be right.

However, consider the alternative, given the premise. The next available powers
of two are 8:1 for vanilla, and 16:1 for expensive. I consider that excessive.
